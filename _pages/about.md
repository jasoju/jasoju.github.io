I am a first year PhD student at the [Chair of Data Science in the Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/information-systems/chairs/prof-dr-strohmaier/) in the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/), supervised by [Prof. Markus Strohmaier](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/information-systems/chairs/prof-dr-strohmaier/team/prof-dr-markus-strohmaier/). 

Previously, I obtained a B.Sc. in Psychology and a M.Sc. in Data Science at the University of Mannheim. In my Master thesis I explored if a psychological assessment can be used to measure sexism in Large Language Models.
